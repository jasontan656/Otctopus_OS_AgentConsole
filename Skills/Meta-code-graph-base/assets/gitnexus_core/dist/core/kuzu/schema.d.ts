/**
 * KuzuDB Schema Definitions
 *
 * Hybrid Schema:
 * - Separate node tables for each code element type (File, Function, Class, etc.)
 * - Single CodeRelation table with 'type' property for all relationships
 *
 * This allows tools to write natural Cypher queries like:
 *   MATCH (f:Function)-[r:CodeRelation {type: 'CALLS'}]->(g:Function) RETURN f, g
